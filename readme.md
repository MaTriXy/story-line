[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meijin007/story-line.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meijin007/story-line) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/meijin007/story-line/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/meijin007/story-line?branch=master)
<br />
## Backend Architecture
* Heavily use of Dependency Injection (without any framework).
* Express.js __Controllers__  accepting a
* __Service__ which is in abstract on the
* __Model__ which is defined using [TypeORM]([https://typeorm.io/]) as ORM.
  * Currently using Sqlite3.

## Tests
* Every testable class under `src/` should have a co-responding test suit in `test/`.
* run `npm run test` to run all the tests with coverage information.
* CI (Travis) should run `npm run test:ci` for sending coverage data to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/meijin007/story-line).
